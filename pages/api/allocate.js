// /api/allocate API interface to allocate players to games. Done by admin/GM on /admin/allocateGames page.
//
// NB: Also need a reset function (and a reset function for nominations, though that isn't used atm)

// First things first! - Save games/allocations in separate collection, or add property to existing??
